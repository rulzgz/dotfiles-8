This system theme is based on a lighter contrast variant of [Hybrid](https://github.com/w0ng/vim-hybrid) matched to [Arc-Grey-Dark](https://github.com/eti0/arc-grey-theme) GTK theme. You can find my fork of Hybrid [here](https://github.com/kingkobra87/vim-hybrid/). Tiled wallpaper generated [here](http://bg.siteorigin.com/).
